# Cellular Automata GUI with Coarse-Graining Visualization

This GUI allows visualization of 1D, elementary [cellular automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) with cell states in the x-axis and time in the y-axis. It also allows coarse-graining of a cellular-automaton rule and animated growth.

## Features

* Visualization of:
  * static cellular automaton
  * growing cellular automaton
  * coarse-grained cellular automaton (via majority rule)
* Access to cellular automaton data across time (2D) for research purposes

## Getting Started

For pure interface usage, download the cellularautomata.jar file or run the CAMVC.java. See all other files for source code and access to cellular automata state data.

The GUI is preloaded with rule 110 and looks like this:

This is after pressing the coarse-grain button just once:
